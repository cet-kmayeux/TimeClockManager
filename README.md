# TimeClockManager

This program utilizes POST requests in order to automate Clocking In and Clocking Out on a SwipClock frontend. Credentials are gathered from the user and stored using OS provided password managers.

A GUI is provided for ease of use, and I plan on updating to add more functionality to the GUI in future releases.
